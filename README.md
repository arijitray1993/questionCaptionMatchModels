# questionCaptionMatchModels

Code for identifying True vs False Premise questions for a given image as described in the paper, Question Relevance in VQA:
Identifying Non-Visual And False-Premise Questions,  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06622v2.pdf

How to run the code:

```python questionCaptionModel.py --captype [option1] --model [option2] --loadweights [option3] --saveModel [option4]```

Options are:

- [option1] :
  - ```qc``` for question-caption similarity.
  - ```qq``` for question-question similarity.
  - ```qdq``` This method is not described in the paper and is an experimental method where the similarity is computed between the test question and a set of diverse questions generated by a captioning model. 
  
- [option2] :
  - ```bow``` : concatenates test question and generated question/caption features by Bag-of-Words technique 
  - ```avgw2v``` : concatenates test question and generated question/caption features by averaging word2vec.
  - ```lstm``` : concatenates test question and generated question/caption features by feeding in the word2vec vectors into an lstm
  
- [option3] : (optional) Path of pretrained weights. You will find some pretrained weights in the ```outputmodels/``` folder. The following are the weights used in the final paper:
  - Question-Caption Match:
    - BoW:  ```outputmodels/2016-08-24\ 02\:51\:48.482004_qc_bow.h5```
    - Avg Word2Vec:  ```outputmodels/2016-08-24\ 02\:47\:17.626481_qc_avgw2v.h5```
    - LSTM:  ```outputmodels/2016-08-24\ 03\:32\:01.409005_qc_lstm.h5 ```
  - Question-Question Match:
    - BoW:   ```outputmodels/2016-08-24\ 02\:29\:46.027887_qq_bow.h5```
    - Avg Word2Vec: ```outputmodels/2016-08-24\ 02\:19\:07.961071_qq_avgw2v.h5```
    - LSTM:  ```outputmodels/2016-08-24\ 11\:54\:29.343364_qq_lstm.h5```

- [option4] : If [option3] is not specified, the training is executed. Set ```FALSE``` to NOT save your trained model at the end of execution, default value is ```TRUE``` (i.e trained model will be saved)
